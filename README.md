# memento-mori
A minimalist life visualization tool that represents your existence as a grid of weeks. Each square is one week of your life. Mark meaningful moments, explore fascinating statistics, and reflect on time's finite nature. Privacy-first, no sign-up required. Inspired by Stoic philosophy and Apple design. Remember your mortality, live intentionally.
